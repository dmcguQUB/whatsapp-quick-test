# Changelog

All notable changes to the WhatsApp Fitness Bot project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### 2025-10-04 - Support for .env.local Configuration ✅

**Enhanced environment variable loading to support .env.local**

#### Changed
- **Updated `src/config.py`** to load both `.env.local` and `.env` files
  - `.env.local` takes precedence (useful for local development)
  - `.env` remains as the default (already in `.gitignore`)
- Allows developers to use `.env.local` without renaming

#### Benefits
- ✅ Supports standard `.env.local` pattern used in many frameworks
- ✅ No need to rename environment files
- ✅ `.env.local` already ignored by Git
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing `.env` setup

---

  - Flask Secret Key generation (Python secrets module)
  - PostgreSQL local database setup (macOS, Windows, Linux)
  - Twilio WhatsApp API configuration (Account SID, Auth Token, Sandbox setup)
  - Anthropic Claude API key acquisition and billing setup
  - Application URL configuration (local and production)
  - Railway production deployment setup
- **Updated `README.md`** to reference the new Environment Setup Guide
- Added security checklist and cost estimates for MVP

#### Benefits

- ✅ App runs without PORT environment variable override
- ✅ Cleaner developer experience

### 2025-10-04 - Project Structure Refactoring ✅

**Refactored project structure for better maintainability**

#### Changed
- **Reorganized codebase** into modular structure:
  - Created `src/` directory for all application code
  - Moved `app.py` → `src/app.py` (now uses application factory pattern)
  - Created `src/config.py` for centralized configuration management
  - Created `run.py` as application entry point
- **Added module structure**:
  - `src/models/` - Database models (ready for Ticket 2.1)
  - `src/services/` - Business logic services (Twilio, Claude, Scheduler)
  - `src/handlers/` - Message handlers (Onboarding, Check-ins, Analysis)
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions (Parsers, Formatters, Timezone)
  - `tests/` - Test suite directory
- **Created `__init__.py`** files for all modules with documentation
- **Updated `README.md`** with new project structure and updated run command

#### Benefits
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to maintain and scale
- ✅ Ready for future ticket implementations
- ✅ Follows Python best practices
